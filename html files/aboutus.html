    <h1> <b><i>OUR STORY</i></b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p1> Gupta Buildhomz was started with the express intention of Bridging the gap that exists between peopleâ€™s perception of their personal spaces & the stark reality of the buildings coming up in our urban spaces.<br></br>

        Experience lies in holistic designs for individual residences, bungalows, development of housing layouts, apartment complexes, commercial complexes and gated communities.<br></br>
        
        As builders in Delhi, the firm transcends the divide between contemporary architecture and the cultural context which they are set in.<br></br> Add the rising need for energy efficient green buildings and increased stress on optimization of available spaces.<br></br>
        
         At Gupta Buildhomz we challenges new magnitudes of demand and growing expectations of home architecture as well as interior architecture clients. <br></br> Creating healthy, lively and enthralling spaces; in the process ensuring that everyone involved is on the same page on energy efficiency and sustainable architecture norms.<br></br></p1>
